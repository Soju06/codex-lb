# responses-api-compat — Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Non-message system and developer input items are preserved

When normalizing Responses or compact request `input`, the service MUST only
hoist items that are instruction messages — `system`/`developer`-role items
whose `type` is omitted or `"message"` — into the top-level `instructions`
field. Any `system`/`developer`-role input item carrying any other `type`
value, including item types the service does not model, MUST be forwarded
upstream unchanged and in its original input position. This preservation MUST
hold both when the request is validated and when the request is serialized for
upstream delivery. Requests whose input contains an `additional_tools` item
remain governed by the Responses Lite rule that leaves the entire input array
and top-level `instructions` unchanged.

#### Scenario: unknown non-message developer input item survives normalization

- **WHEN** a Responses or compact request `input` contains a typed, non-message
  item such as `{"type": "future_directive", "role": "developer", ...}`
  alongside developer instruction messages and user messages
- **THEN** the developer instruction messages are hoisted into `instructions`
- **AND** the `future_directive` item remains in `input` unchanged, in its
  original position
- **AND** the upstream-serialized payload retains the item unchanged

#### Scenario: typeless system messages keep hoisting behavior

- **WHEN** an OpenAI-compatible client sends `input` containing
  `{"role": "system", "content": "sys"}` without a `type` field
- **THEN** that item is hoisted into `instructions` as before
