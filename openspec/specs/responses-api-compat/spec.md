# responses-api-compat Specification

## Purpose

Define Responses API compatibility contracts so Codex, OpenCode, and OpenAI-style clients preserve expected behavior.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Use prompt_cache_key as OpenAI cache affinity
For OpenAI-style `/v1/responses`, `/v1/responses/compact`, and chat-completions requests mapped onto Responses, the service MUST treat a non-empty `prompt_cache_key` as the bounded upstream account affinity key for prompt-cache correctness even when a `session_id` header is present. This affinity MUST apply even when dashboard `sticky_threads_enabled` is disabled, the service MUST continue forwarding the same `prompt_cache_key` upstream unchanged, and the stored affinity MUST expire after the configured freshness window so older keys can rebalance. The freshness window MUST come from dashboard settings so operators can adjust it without restart. OpenAI-style route wiring MUST NOT upgrade those requests to durable `CODEX_SESSION` affinity by default.

#### Scenario: OpenAI-style route ignores session header for durable codex-session pinning
- **WHEN** a client sends `/v1/responses` or `/v1/responses/compact` with a non-empty `session_id` header and no explicit sticky-thread mode
- **THEN** the service does not persist a durable `codex_session` mapping solely from that header
- **AND** bounded prompt-cache affinity behavior remains in effect

#### Scenario: dashboard prompt-cache affinity TTL is applied
- **WHEN** an operator updates the dashboard prompt-cache affinity TTL
- **THEN** subsequent OpenAI-style prompt-cache affinity decisions use the new freshness window

### Requirement: Responses requests reject uploaded input_image references
The system SHALL accept `{"type":"input_file","file_id":"file_*"}` attached-file items in `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses`, and `/responses/compact` request payloads and forward them verbatim.

When an `input_image` part contains a `file_id` field or an `image_url` starting with `sediment://`, the proxy MUST return HTTP 400 with `error.code = "unsupported_input_image_format"` and an explanation that the upstream Responses API only accepts inline `data:` URLs for `input_image`. The proxy MUST NOT fetch the upload, MUST NOT inline-convert the image, and MUST NOT trim, slim, or rewrite any conversation content.

#### Scenario: input_image file_id is rejected before forwarding
- **WHEN** a `/v1/responses` request contains `{"type":"input_image","file_id":"file_img"}`
- **THEN** the proxy returns HTTP 400 with `error.code = "unsupported_input_image_format"`
- **AND** the response explains that inline `data:` URLs are the supported `input_image` contract

#### Scenario: sediment upload URL is rejected before forwarding
- **WHEN** a `/responses/compact` request contains `{"type":"input_image","image_url":"sediment://file_img"}`
- **THEN** the proxy returns HTTP 400 with `error.code = "unsupported_input_image_format"`
- **AND** does not fetch or inline-convert the upload

### Requirement: Oversized responses request payloads fall back to HTTP
When `upstream_stream_transport` is `"auto"` and the serialized request payload size exceeds the WebSocket frame budget, the proxy MUST use upstream HTTP `POST` instead of WebSocket. If the HTTP responses bridge is enabled and the same oversized request would otherwise route through the bridge, the proxy MUST bypass the bridge for that request only and send it over raw HTTP. Explicit `upstream_stream_transport` overrides MUST still take precedence.

#### Scenario: large request payload routes via HTTP transport on auto
- **GIVEN** `upstream_stream_transport` is `"auto"` and the request payload size exceeds the WebSocket frame budget
- **WHEN** the proxy resolves the upstream transport
- **THEN** the request MUST be sent over HTTP `POST` instead of WebSocket
- **AND** explicit `upstream_stream_transport = "websocket"` overrides MUST still take precedence

#### Scenario: large request payload bypasses the HTTP responses bridge
- **GIVEN** the HTTP responses bridge is enabled and the request payload exceeds the WebSocket frame budget
- **WHEN** the proxy receives a `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses`, or `/responses/compact` request
- **THEN** the bridge MUST be bypassed for that request and the request MUST be sent over raw HTTP
- **AND** subsequent smaller requests MUST continue to use the bridge normally

### Requirement: Clean upstream close before any response event fails fast
When the HTTP responses bridge observes an upstream websocket close with `close_code = 1000` before any `response.*` event has been surfaced for the pending request, the proxy MUST classify the close as rejected input, surface HTTP 502 `upstream_rejected_input`, and MUST NOT trigger `retry_precreated` or `retry_fresh_upstream`.

#### Scenario: clean close before response.created is not retried
- **WHEN** upstream closes the HTTP responses bridge with `close_code = 1000` before any `response.*` event for the pending request
- **THEN** the proxy returns HTTP 502 with `error.code = "upstream_rejected_input"`
- **AND** does not transparently replay the pre-created request

### Requirement: Native `/backend-api/codex` routes accept the Codex tool surface
The service MUST accept native `/backend-api/codex/responses` HTTP and websocket requests that include the Codex Desktop tool surface. This includes custom tools plus built-in Codex tool types such as `image_generation`, `file_search`, `code_interpreter`, and `computer_use_preview`. The service MUST continue normalizing `web_search_preview` to `web_search` before forwarding upstream. OpenAI-style `/v1/*` routes MUST keep rejecting unsupported built-in tools with an `invalid_request_error`.

#### Scenario: Auto transport prefers HTTP for image-generation tool requests
- **WHEN** the resolved upstream transport strategy is `"auto"`
- **AND** the request includes a built-in `image_generation` tool
- **THEN** the proxy chooses the upstream HTTP/SSE transport even if the model would otherwise prefer websocket

#### Scenario: backend responses accept native built-in and custom tools
- **WHEN** a client sends `/backend-api/codex/responses` with tools including `{"type":"custom","name":"exec"}` and `{"type":"image_generation"}`
- **THEN** the service accepts the request and forwards the tools upstream without returning an `invalid_request_error`

#### Scenario: v1 responses continue rejecting unsupported built-in tools
- **WHEN** a client sends `/v1/responses` with `tools=[{"type":"image_generation"}]`
- **THEN** the service returns a 4xx OpenAI `invalid_request_error` indicating the unsupported tool type

### Requirement: Bridge-enabled worker pools use addressable bridge owners

When the HTTP responses session bridge is enabled and the configured runtime worker count is greater than one, the service MUST NOT start a plain Uvicorn multi-worker process group with a shared bridge instance id. It MUST instead start a front listener plus single-worker backend processes where each backend has a unique bridge instance id and an advertised endpoint that can route owner handoff to that worker-local bridge session map.

#### Scenario: bridge-enabled multi-worker startup uses addressable workers

- **WHEN** the HTTP responses session bridge is enabled
- **AND** the configured worker count is greater than one
- **THEN** startup launches single-worker backend app processes with unique bridge instance ids
- **AND** each backend advertises a worker-specific bridge endpoint
- **AND** public HTTP and WebSocket traffic enters through one front listener

#### Scenario: bridge-disabled multi-worker startup remains plain Uvicorn

- **WHEN** the HTTP responses session bridge is disabled
- **AND** the configured worker count is greater than one
- **THEN** startup continues to pass the requested worker count directly to Uvicorn

### Requirement: Continuity-dependent Responses follow-ups fail closed with retryable errors
When a Responses follow-up depends on previously established continuity state, the service MUST return a retryable continuity error if that continuity cannot be reconstructed safely. The service MUST NOT expose raw `previous_response_not_found` for bridge-local metadata loss or similar internal continuity gaps.

#### Scenario: HTTP bridge loses local continuity metadata for a follow-up request
- **WHEN** an HTTP `/v1/responses` or `/backend-api/codex/responses` follow-up request depends on `previous_response_id` or a hard continuity turn-state
- **AND** the bridge cannot reconstruct the matching live continuity state from local or durable metadata
- **THEN** the service returns a retryable OpenAI-format error
- **AND** the error code is not `previous_response_not_found`

#### Scenario: in-flight bridge follower loses continuity while waiting on the same canonical session
- **WHEN** a follow-up request waits on an in-flight HTTP bridge session for the same hard continuity key
- **AND** the bridge still cannot reconstruct safe continuity state once the leader finishes
- **THEN** the service returns a retryable OpenAI-format error
- **AND** the error code is not `previous_response_not_found`

#### Scenario: multiplexed follow-ups fail closed only for the matching continuity anchor
- **WHEN** a websocket or HTTP bridge session has multiple pending follow-up requests with different `previous_response_id` anchors
- **AND** continuity loss is detected for exactly one of those anchors
- **THEN** the service applies the retryable fail-closed continuity error only to the matching follow-up request
- **AND** it does not expose raw `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** unrelated pending requests continue on their own response lifecycle

#### Scenario: multiplexed follow-ups sharing one anchor fail closed together without leaking raw continuity errors
- **WHEN** a websocket or HTTP bridge session has multiple pending follow-up requests that share the same `previous_response_id` anchor
- **AND** upstream emits an anonymous continuity loss event such as `previous_response_not_found` for that shared anchor
- **THEN** the service rewrites each affected follow-up into a retryable continuity error
- **AND** no affected follow-up exposes raw `previous_response_not_found`
- **AND** the run remains usable for subsequent requests after the rewritten failures

#### Scenario: single pre-created follow-up still fails closed when continuity loss omits explicit response id in message
- **WHEN** a websocket follow-up request is pending with `previous_response_id` and has not received a stable upstream `response.id` yet
- **AND** upstream emits `previous_response_not_found` with `param=previous_response_id`
- **AND** the upstream error message omits the literal previous response identifier
- **THEN** the service still maps that continuity loss to the pending follow-up
- **AND** it rewrites the downstream terminal event to a retryable continuity error
- **AND** it does not surface raw `previous_response_not_found` to the client

### Requirement: Hard continuity owner lookup fails closed
When a request depends on hard continuity ownership, the service MUST fail closed if owner or ring lookup errors prevent safe pinning. The service MUST NOT continue with local recovery or account selection that bypasses hard owner enforcement.

#### Scenario: websocket previous-response owner lookup errors
- **WHEN** a websocket or HTTP fallback follow-up request includes `previous_response_id`
- **AND** owner lookup errors prevent the proxy from determining the required owner account
- **THEN** the service returns a retryable OpenAI-format error
- **AND** it does not continue the request on an unpinned account

#### Scenario: bridge owner or ring lookup errors for hard continuity keys
- **WHEN** an HTTP bridge request uses a hard continuity key such as turn-state, explicit session affinity, or `previous_response_id`
- **AND** owner or ring lookup errors prevent the proxy from proving the correct bridge owner
- **THEN** the service returns a retryable OpenAI-format error
- **AND** it does not create or recover a local bridge session on the current replica

### Requirement: Codex backend session_id preserves account affinity
When a backend Codex Responses or compact request includes a non-empty accepted session header, the service MUST use that value as the routing affinity key for upstream account selection. If the request lacks a client-supplied `prompt_cache_key`, the service MUST derive and attach a stable `prompt_cache_key` before upstream forwarding so account affinity and upstream prompt-cache routing can coexist. Accepted session headers are `session_id`, `x-codex-session-id`, and `x-codex-conversation-id`, in that priority order.

#### Scenario: Backend Codex request derives prompt_cache_key before codex-session routing
- **WHEN** `/backend-api/codex/responses` is called with `session_id` and without `prompt_cache_key`
- **THEN** the routing decision still uses durable `codex_session` affinity for account selection
- **AND** the forwarded upstream payload includes a derived stable `prompt_cache_key`

### Requirement: Proxy-generated prompt cache key derivation is operator-toggleable
The service MUST provide a runtime flag that disables only proxy-generated prompt-cache-key derivation. When disabled, the service MUST continue forwarding any client-supplied `prompt_cache_key` unchanged and MUST NOT synthesize a new one.

#### Scenario: Derivation disabled preserves client-supplied key
- **WHEN** the derivation flag is disabled and a client sends `prompt_cache_key`
- **THEN** the service forwards that key unchanged
- **AND** it does not generate a replacement key
