# api-keys Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change admin-auth-and-api-keys. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: API Key creation

The system SHALL allow the admin to create API keys via `POST /api/api-keys` with a `name` (required), `allowed_models` (optional list), `weekly_token_limit` (optional integer), and `expires_at` (optional ISO 8601 datetime). The system MUST generate a key in the format `sk-clb-{48 hex chars}`, store only the `sha256` hash in the database, and return the plain key exactly once in the creation response. The system MUST accept timezone-aware ISO 8601 datetimes for `expiresAt`, normalize them to UTC naive for persistence, and return the expiration as UTC in API responses.

#### Scenario: Create key with all options

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with `{ "name": "dev-key", "allowedModels": ["o3-pro"], "weeklyTokenLimit": 1000000, "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z" }`
- **THEN** the system returns `{ "id": "<uuid>", "name": "dev-key", "key": "sk-clb-...", "keyPrefix": "sk-clb-a1b2c3d4", "allowedModels": ["o3-pro"], "weeklyTokenLimit": 1000000, "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z", "createdAt": "..." }` with the plain key visible only in this response

#### Scenario: Create key with timezone-aware expiration

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with `{ "name": "dev-key", "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z" }`
- **THEN** the system persists the expiration successfully without PostgreSQL datetime binding errors
- **AND** the response returns `expiresAt` representing the same UTC instant

#### Scenario: Create key with defaults

- **WHEN** admin submits `POST /api/api-keys` with `{ "name": "open-key" }` and no optional fields
- **THEN** the system creates a key with `allowedModels: null` (all models), `weeklyTokenLimit: null` (unlimited), `expiresAt: null` (no expiration)

#### Scenario: Create key with duplicate name

- **WHEN** admin submits a key with a `name` that already exists
- **THEN** the system creates the key (names are labels, not unique constraints)

### Requirement: API Key listing

The system SHALL expose `GET /api/api-keys` returning all API keys with their metadata. The response MUST NOT include the key hash or plain key. Each key MUST include `id`, `name`, `keyPrefix`, `allowedModels`, `weeklyTokenLimit`, `weeklyTokensUsed`, `weeklyResetAt`, `expiresAt`, `isActive`, `createdAt`, and `lastUsedAt`.

#### Scenario: List keys

- **WHEN** admin calls `GET /api/api-keys`
- **THEN** the system returns an array of key objects ordered by `createdAt` descending, without `key` or `keyHash` fields

#### Scenario: No keys exist

- **WHEN** no API keys have been created
- **THEN** the system returns an empty array `[]`

### Requirement: API Key update

The system SHALL allow updating key properties via `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}`. Updatable fields: `name`, `allowedModels`, `weeklyTokenLimit`, `expiresAt`, `isActive`. The key hash and prefix MUST NOT be modifiable. The system MUST accept timezone-aware ISO 8601 datetimes for `expiresAt` and normalize them to UTC naive before persistence.

#### Scenario: Update allowed models

- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with `{ "allowedModels": ["o3-pro", "gpt-4.1"] }`
- **THEN** the system updates the allowed models list and returns the updated key

#### Scenario: Deactivate key

- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with `{ "isActive": false }`
- **THEN** the key is deactivated; subsequent Bearer requests using this key SHALL be rejected with 401

#### Scenario: Update key with timezone-aware expiration

- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with `{ "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T00:00:00Z" }`
- **THEN** the system persists the expiration successfully without PostgreSQL datetime binding errors
- **AND** the response returns `expiresAt` representing the same UTC instant

#### Scenario: Update non-existent key

- **WHEN** admin submits `PATCH /api/api-keys/{id}` with an unknown ID
- **THEN** the system returns 404

### Requirement: API Key deletion

The system SHALL allow deleting an API key via `DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}`. Deletion MUST be permanent and the key MUST immediately stop authenticating.

#### Scenario: Delete existing key

- **WHEN** admin calls `DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}` for an existing key
- **THEN** the key is permanently removed from the database and returns 204

#### Scenario: Delete non-existent key

- **WHEN** admin calls `DELETE /api/api-keys/{id}` with an unknown ID
- **THEN** the system returns 404

### Requirement: API Key regeneration

The system SHALL allow regenerating an API key via `POST /api/api-keys/{id}/regenerate`. This MUST generate a new key value (new hash, new prefix) while preserving all other properties (name, models, limits, expiration). The new plain key MUST be returned exactly once.

#### Scenario: Regenerate key

- **WHEN** admin calls `POST /api/api-keys/{id}/regenerate`
- **THEN** the system returns the updated key object with a new `key` and `keyPrefix`; the old key immediately stops authenticating

### Requirement: API Key authentication global switch

The system SHALL provide an `api_key_auth_enabled` boolean in `DashboardSettings`. When false (default), all proxy endpoints allow unauthenticated access. When true, all proxy endpoints require a valid API key via `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.

#### Scenario: Enable API key auth

- **WHEN** admin submits `PUT /api/settings` with `{ "apiKeyAuthEnabled": true }`
- **THEN** subsequent proxy requests without a valid Bearer token are rejected with 401

#### Scenario: Disable API key auth

- **WHEN** admin submits `PUT /api/settings` with `{ "apiKeyAuthEnabled": false }`
- **THEN** proxy requests are allowed without authentication

#### Scenario: Enable without any keys created

- **WHEN** admin enables API key auth but no keys exist
- **THEN** all proxy requests are rejected with 401 (the system SHALL NOT prevent enabling even if no keys exist)

### Requirement: API Key Bearer authentication guard

The system SHALL validate API keys on proxy routes (`/v1/*`, `/backend-api/codex/*`, `/backend-api/transcribe`) when `api_key_auth_enabled` is true. Validation MUST be implemented as a router-level `Security` dependency, not ASGI middleware. The dependency MUST compute `sha256` of the Bearer token and look up the hash in the `api_keys` table.

The dependency SHALL return a typed `ApiKeyData` value directly to the route handler. Route handlers MUST NOT access API key data via `request.state`.

`/api/codex/usage` SHALL NOT be covered by the API key auth guard scope.

The dependency SHALL raise a domain exception on validation failure. The exception handler SHALL format the response using the OpenAI error envelope.

#### Scenario: API key guard route scope

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is true and a request is made to `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, or `/backend-api/transcribe`
- **THEN** the API key guard validation is applied

#### Scenario: Codex usage excluded from API key guard scope

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is true and a request is made to `/api/codex/usage`
- **THEN** API key guard validation is not applied

#### Scenario: Valid API key injected into handler

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is true and a valid Bearer token is provided
- **THEN** the route handler receives a typed `ApiKeyData` parameter (not `request.state`)

#### Scenario: API key auth disabled returns None

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false
- **THEN** the dependency returns `None` and the request proceeds without authentication

### Requirement: Model restriction enforcement

The system SHALL enforce per-key model restrictions in the proxy service layer (not middleware). When `allowed_models` is set (non-null, non-empty) and the requested model is not in the list, the system MUST reject the request. The `/v1/models` endpoint MUST filter the model list based on the authenticated key's `allowed_models`.

For fixed-model endpoints such as `/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `/backend-api/transcribe`, the service MUST evaluate restrictions against fixed effective model `gpt-4o-transcribe`.

#### Scenario: Requested model not allowed

- **WHEN** a key has `allowed_models: ["o3-pro"]` and a request is made for model `gpt-4.1`
- **THEN** the proxy returns 403 with OpenAI-format error `{ "error": { "code": "model_not_allowed", "message": "This API key does not have access to model 'gpt-4.1'" } }`

#### Scenario: All models allowed

- **WHEN** a key has `allowed_models: null`
- **THEN** any model is permitted

#### Scenario: Model list filtered

- **WHEN** a key with `allowed_models: ["o3-pro"]` calls `GET /v1/models`
- **THEN** the response contains only models matching the allowed list

#### Scenario: No API key auth (disabled)

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false and a request is made to `/v1/models`
- **THEN** the full model catalog is returned

#### Scenario: Fixed transcription model not allowed

- **WHEN** a key has `allowed_models: ["gpt-5.1"]` and a request is made to `/v1/audio/transcriptions` or `/backend-api/transcribe`
- **THEN** the proxy returns 403 with OpenAI-format error code `model_not_allowed` for model `gpt-4o-transcribe`

### Requirement: Weekly token usage tracking

The system SHALL atomically increment `weekly_tokens_used` on the API key record when a proxy request completes with token usage data. The token count MUST be `input_tokens + output_tokens`. If token usage is unavailable (error response), the counter MUST NOT be incremented.

#### Scenario: Successful request with usage

- **WHEN** a proxy request completes with `input_tokens: 100, output_tokens: 50` for an authenticated key
- **THEN** `weekly_tokens_used` is atomically incremented by 150

#### Scenario: Request with no usage data

- **WHEN** a proxy request fails with an error and no usage data is returned
- **THEN** `weekly_tokens_used` is not incremented

#### Scenario: Request without API key auth

- **WHEN** `api_key_auth_enabled` is false and a proxy request completes
- **THEN** no API key usage tracking occurs

### Requirement: Weekly token usage reset

The system SHALL reset `weekly_tokens_used` to 0 using a lazy on-read strategy. When validating an API key, if `weekly_reset_at < now()`, the system MUST reset the counter and advance `weekly_reset_at` by 7-day intervals until it is in the future.

#### Scenario: Weekly reset triggered on validation

- **WHEN** an API key is validated and `weekly_reset_at` is 2 weeks in the past
- **THEN** `weekly_tokens_used` is set to 0 and `weekly_reset_at` is advanced by 14 days (2 × 7 days) to a future date

#### Scenario: No reset needed

- **WHEN** an API key is validated and `weekly_reset_at` is in the future
- **THEN** no reset occurs; `weekly_tokens_used` retains its current value

### Requirement: RequestLog API key reference

The system SHALL record the `api_key_id` in the `request_logs` table for proxy requests authenticated with an API key. The field MUST be NULL when API key auth is disabled or the request is unauthenticated.

#### Scenario: Authenticated request logged

- **WHEN** a proxy request is authenticated with API key `key-123` and completes
- **THEN** the `request_logs` entry has `api_key_id = "key-123"`

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated request logged

- **WHEN** API key auth is disabled and a proxy request completes
- **THEN** the `request_logs` entry has `api_key_id = NULL`

### Requirement: Frontend API Key management

The SPA settings page SHALL include an API Key management section with: a toggle for `apiKeyAuthEnabled`, a key list table showing prefix/name/models/limit/usage/expiry/status, a create dialog (name, model selection, weekly limit, expiry date), and key actions (edit, delete, regenerate). On key creation, the SPA MUST display the plain key in a copy-able dialog with a warning that it will not be shown again.

#### Scenario: Create key and show plain key

- **WHEN** admin creates a key via the UI
- **THEN** a dialog shows the full plain key with a copy button and a warning message

#### Scenario: Toggle API key auth

- **WHEN** admin toggles `apiKeyAuthEnabled` in settings
- **THEN** the system calls `PUT /api/settings` and reflects the new state

### Requirement: Cost accounting uses model and service-tier pricing
When computing API key `cost_usd` usage, the system MUST price requests using the resolved model pricing and the authoritative `service_tier` reported by the upstream response when available, falling back to the forwarded request `service_tier` only when the response omits it. Requests sent with non-standard service tiers MUST use the published pricing for the tier actually used instead of falling back to standard-tier pricing.

#### Scenario: Priority-tier request increments cost limit
- **WHEN** an authenticated request for a priced model is finalized with `service_tier: "priority"`
- **THEN** the system computes `cost_usd` using the priority-tier rate for that model

#### Scenario: Flex-tier request increments cost limit
- **WHEN** an authenticated request for a priced model is finalized with `service_tier: "flex"`
- **THEN** the system computes `cost_usd` using the flex-tier rate for that model

#### Scenario: Standard-tier request keeps standard pricing
- **WHEN** an authenticated request for the same model is finalized without `service_tier`
- **THEN** the system computes `cost_usd` using the standard-tier rate

### Requirement: gpt-5.4 pricing is recognized
The system MUST recognize `gpt-5.4` pricing when computing request costs. For standard-tier requests with more than 272K input tokens, the system MUST apply the published higher long-context rates.

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4 request priced at standard tier
- **WHEN** a request for `gpt-5.4` completes with standard service tier
- **THEN** the system computes non-zero cost using the configured `gpt-5.4` standard rates

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4 long-context request priced at long-context rates
- **WHEN** a standard-tier `gpt-5.4` request completes with more than 272K input tokens
- **THEN** the system computes cost using the configured long-context `gpt-5.4` rates

### Requirement: Model-scoped limit enforcement

The system SHALL separate authentication validation from quota enforcement. `validate_key()` in the auth guard SHALL only verify key validity (existence, active status, expiry, basic reset). Quota enforcement SHALL occur at a point where the request model is known.

Limit applicability rules:
- `limit.model_filter is None` → always applies (global limit)
- `limit.model_filter == request_model` → applies (model-scoped limit)
- otherwise → does not apply for this request

For model-less requests (e.g., `/v1/models`), only global limits SHALL be evaluated.

The service contract SHALL be typed explicitly: `enforce_limits_for_request(key_id: str, *, request_model: str | None, request_service_tier: str | None = None) -> None`.

#### Scenario: Model-scoped limit does not block other models

- **WHEN** `model_filter="gpt-5.1"` limit is exhausted
- **AND** request model is `gpt-4o-mini`
- **THEN** the request is allowed

#### Scenario: Model-scoped limit blocks matching model

- **WHEN** `model_filter="gpt-5.1"` limit is exhausted
- **AND** request model is `gpt-5.1`
- **THEN** the request returns 429

#### Scenario: Model-scoped limit does not block model-less endpoints

- **WHEN** `model_filter="gpt-5.1"` limit is exhausted
- **AND** request is to `/v1/models` (no model context)
- **THEN** the request is allowed

#### Scenario: Global limit blocks all proxy requests

- **WHEN** a global limit (no `model_filter`) is exhausted
- **THEN** all proxy requests return 429

### Requirement: Limit update with usage state preservation

When updating API key limits, the system SHALL preserve existing usage state (`current_value`, `reset_at`) for unchanged limit rules. Limit comparison key is `(limit_type, limit_window, model_filter)`.

- Matching existing rule: `current_value` and `reset_at` SHALL be preserved; only `max_value` is updated
- New rule (no match): `current_value=0` and fresh `reset_at`
- Removed rule (in existing but not in update): row is deleted

Usage reset SHALL only occur via an explicit action (`reset_usage` field or dedicated endpoint), never as a side-effect of metadata or policy edits.

#### Scenario: Metadata-only edit preserves usage state

- **WHEN** an API key PATCH updates only name or is_active
- **AND** `limits` field is not included in the payload
- **THEN** existing `current_value` and `reset_at` are unchanged

#### Scenario: Same policy re-submission preserves usage state

- **WHEN** an API key PATCH includes `limits` with identical rules (same type/window/filter/max_value)
- **THEN** existing `current_value` and `reset_at` are unchanged

#### Scenario: max_value adjustment preserves counters

- **WHEN** an API key PATCH includes `limits` with a changed `max_value` for an existing rule
- **THEN** `current_value` and `reset_at` are preserved; only the threshold changes

#### Scenario: Explicit reset action resets usage

- **WHEN** an explicit usage reset action is invoked
- **THEN** `current_value` is set to 0 and `reset_at` is refreshed

### Requirement: API key edit payload — conditional limits transmission

The frontend API key edit dialog SHALL transmit `limits` in the PATCH payload only when limit values have actually changed. The system SHALL normalize and compare initial and current limit values to detect changes.

- Metadata-only changes (name, is_active): `limits` field MUST be omitted from the payload
- Identical rule sets with different ordering: MUST be treated as unchanged (`limits` omitted)

Backend contract:
- `limits` absent in payload: limit policy unchanged (usage/reset state preserved)
- `limits` present in payload: policy replacement (state-preserving upsert applied)

#### Scenario: Name-only edit omits limits from payload

- **WHEN** only the API key name is modified in the edit dialog
- **THEN** the PATCH payload does not include the `limits` field

#### Scenario: Reordered identical rules treated as unchanged

- **WHEN** the same limit rules are submitted in a different order
- **THEN** the system treats this as unchanged and omits `limits` from the payload

### Requirement: Public model list filtering

All model list endpoints SHALL filter models using a single predicate that requires both conditions:
1. `model.supported_in_api` is true
2. If `allowed_models` is configured, the model is in the allowed set

This predicate SHALL be applied consistently across `/api/models`, `/v1/models`, and `/backend-api/codex/models`.

#### Scenario: Unsupported model excluded from /v1/models

- **WHEN** a model snapshot contains a model with `supported_in_api=false`
- **THEN** that model is not included in the `/v1/models` response

#### Scenario: Unsupported model excluded from /backend-api/codex/models

- **WHEN** a model snapshot contains a model with `supported_in_api=false`
- **THEN** that model is not included in the `/backend-api/codex/models` response

#### Scenario: Allowed but unsupported model excluded

- **WHEN** a model is in the `allowed_models` set but has `supported_in_api=false`
- **THEN** that model is not exposed in any model list endpoint

#### Scenario: Consistent model set across endpoints

- **GIVEN** any model registry state
- **THEN** `/api/models`, `/v1/models`, and `/backend-api/codex/models` expose the same set of models

### Requirement: Reservation 정산 exactly-once 보장

Usage reservation의 최종 정산(finalize 또는 release)은 요청 단위에서 정확히 1회 수행되어야 한다. 재시도 가능한 중간 attempt에서는 정산을 defer하고, 요청 종료 시점에서 단일 지점이 정산 책임을 갖는다. 시스템은 이 동작을 SHALL 보장해야 한다.

#### Scenario: 스트림 401 → refresh retry 성공 시 finalize 1회

- **WHEN** 첫 `_stream_once()` attempt에서 401을 수신하고 계정 refresh 후 재시도가 성공하면
- **THEN** 첫 attempt에서는 reservation 정산이 수행되지 않아야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** 최종 성공 시점에서 `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 정확히 1회 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** 실제 token 사용량이 quota에 반영되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 스트림 401 → retry 소진 실패 시 release 1회

- **WHEN** 401 후 재시도를 모두 소진하여 요청이 최종 실패하면
- **THEN** `release_usage_reservation()`이 정확히 1회 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** 예약된 quota가 원복되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 스트림 성공 시 finalize 1회

- **WHEN** `_stream_once()`가 retry 없이 첫 attempt에서 성공하면
- **THEN** `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 정확히 1회 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)

### Requirement: 조기 종료 경로에서 reservation release 보장

Reservation 생성 후 upstream API 호출에 진입하지 않고 종료되는 모든 경로에서 reservation이 release되어야 한다. `reserved` 상태로 남는 reservation이 존재하면 안 된다. 시스템은 이 동작을 SHALL 보장해야 한다.

#### Scenario: no_accounts 즉시 종료 시 release

- **WHEN** reservation 생성 후 `_stream_with_retry()`가 사용 가능한 계정 없음(`no_accounts`)으로 즉시 종료되면
- **THEN** `release_usage_reservation()`이 호출되어 reservation이 `released` 상태로 전이되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** pre-reserved quota가 원복되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 재시도 소진 후 no_accounts 종료 시 release

- **WHEN** 재시도 루프가 모든 attempt를 소진한 후 `no_accounts`로 종료되면
- **THEN** `release_usage_reservation()`이 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: reservation 미생성 시 정산 스킵

- **WHEN** API key auth가 비활성이거나 reservation이 생성되지 않은 상태에서 요청이 종료되면
- **THEN** 정산 로직이 안전하게 스킵되어야 하며 에러가 발생하지 않아야 한다 (SHALL)

### Requirement: Compact 경로 예외 무관 reservation cleanup

`_compact_responses()` 경로에서 reservation이 존재할 때, 어떤 예외 타입이 발생하더라도 reservation이 정리되어야 한다. 특정 예외 타입에만 의존하는 cleanup은 허용되지 않는다. 시스템은 이 동작을 SHALL 보장해야 한다.

#### Scenario: ProxyResponseError 발생 시 release

- **WHEN** `compact_responses()`에서 `ProxyResponseError`가 발생하면
- **THEN** reservation이 release되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 예상 외 런타임 예외 발생 시 release

- **WHEN** `compact_responses()`에서 `ProxyResponseError` 외의 예외(`Exception`)가 발생하면
- **THEN** reservation이 동일하게 release되어야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: compact 성공 시 finalize

- **WHEN** `compact_responses()`가 정상 완료되면
- **THEN** `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 호출되어야 한다 (SHALL)

### Requirement: Finalize / Release 멱등성

`finalize_usage_reservation()`과 `release_usage_reservation()`은 이미 정산된(finalized 또는 released) reservation에 대해 안전하게 no-op 처리되어야 한다. 이중 호출이 quota를 이중 반영하거나 에러를 발생시키면 안 된다. 시스템은 이 동작을 SHALL 보장해야 한다.

#### Scenario: finalize 후 release 호출 시 no-op

- **WHEN** reservation이 이미 `finalized` 상태에서 `release_usage_reservation()`이 호출되면
- **THEN** 아무 동작 없이 반환되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** quota 값이 변경되지 않아야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: release 후 finalize 호출 시 no-op

- **WHEN** reservation이 이미 `released` 상태에서 `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 호출되면
- **THEN** 아무 동작 없이 반환되어야 한다 (SHALL)
- **AND** quota 값이 변경되지 않아야 한다 (SHALL)

#### Scenario: 동일 finalize 이중 호출 시 1회만 반영

- **WHEN** 동일 `reservation_id`로 `finalize_usage_reservation()`이 2회 호출되면
- **THEN** 사용량은 정확히 1회만 반영되어야 한다 (SHALL)
