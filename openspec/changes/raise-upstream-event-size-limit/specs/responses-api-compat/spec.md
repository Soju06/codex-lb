## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Upstream Responses event size budget
The service SHALL allow upstream Responses SSE events and upstream websocket message frames up to 16 MiB by default before treating them as oversized.

#### Scenario: built-in tool output exceeds the old 2 MiB limit
- **WHEN** upstream Responses traffic includes a single SSE event or websocket message frame larger than 2 MiB but not larger than 16 MiB
- **THEN** the proxy continues processing the event instead of closing the upstream websocket locally with `1009 message too big`
