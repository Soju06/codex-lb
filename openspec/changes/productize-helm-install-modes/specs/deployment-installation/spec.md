# deployment-installation Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Helm chart is organized around install modes

The Helm chart MUST document and support three primary install modes: bundled PostgreSQL, direct external database, and external secrets. These install contracts MUST be portable across Kubernetes providers without requiring provider-specific chart forks.

#### Scenario: Bundled mode values exist

- **WHEN** a user wants a self-contained install
- **THEN** the chart provides a bundled mode values overlay with bundled PostgreSQL enabled

#### Scenario: External DB mode values exist

- **WHEN** a user wants to install against an already reachable PostgreSQL database
- **THEN** the chart provides an external DB values overlay and accepts direct DB URL or DB secret wiring

#### Scenario: External secrets mode values exist

- **WHEN** a user wants to source credentials from External Secrets Operator
- **THEN** the chart provides an external secrets values overlay that keeps migration and startup behavior fail-closed

### Requirement: Helm install modes are smoke-tested

The project MUST run automated Helm smoke installs for the easy-setup install modes in CI.

#### Scenario: Bundled and external DB modes are smoke tested

- **WHEN** CI runs Helm smoke installation checks
- **THEN** it installs the chart on a disposable Kubernetes cluster in bundled mode
- **AND** it installs the chart on a disposable Kubernetes cluster in external DB mode
- **AND** both installs reach a healthy testable state
