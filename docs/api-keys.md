# API Key Authentication

API key auth is **disabled by default**. In that mode, only local requests to the protected proxy routes can
proceed without a key; non-local requests are rejected until proxy authentication is configured. Enable it in
**Settings → API Key Auth** on the dashboard when clients connect remotely or through Docker, VM, or container
networking that appears non-local to the service.

When enabled, clients must pass a valid API key as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer sk-clb-...
```

## Protected routes

The protected proxy routes covered by this setting are:

- `/v1/*` (except `/v1/usage`, which always requires a valid key)
- `/backend-api/codex/*`
- `/backend-api/transcribe`

## Creating keys

Dashboard → API Keys → Create. The full key is shown **only once** at creation. Keys support optional expiration, model restrictions, and rate limits (tokens / cost per day / week / month).

Keys can also be scoped to specific accounts, so a key draws quota only from the accounts assigned to it:

## Self-service key dashboard

Open `/key-dashboard` and enter an active API key to view that key's lifetime request, token, cached-token, and cost totals together with its latest request logs. This page does not require the administrator dashboard password.

The key is sent only as a Bearer header and is kept in the current tab's memory; it is cleared when you disconnect or reload the page. The request grid intentionally omits account identity, account plan, API key identity, client metadata, conversation/archive identifiers, routing identifiers, and detailed failure text.

## Reasoning effort policies

A key can either enforce one reasoning effort or allow a selected non-empty set of client-requested efforts.
Leave the allowed-efforts selection empty to keep the existing unrestricted behavior. A request that explicitly
sets an effort outside its key's allowlist receives a `403 reasoning_effort_not_allowed` response. Requests that
omit a reasoning effort continue to use the model or upstream default.

The policy evaluates the effort selected by the client, including supported model aliases such as `-xhigh`.
Each configured effort is distinct: allowing `high` does not allow `xhigh`, and allowing `max` does not allow
`ultra`. The proxy still rewrites an allowed `ultra` request to the upstream wire value `max`.
