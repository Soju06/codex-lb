## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Unanchored process-session concurrency uses independent bridge lanes

When multiple Responses requests share a process-level session header but carry neither `previous_response_id` nor non-blank turn-state continuity, the service MUST NOT queue an independent request behind an active response-create gate. If the canonical bridge is still being created, reserved by another request before submit, already has a visible request, or belongs to a different model class, the service MUST create a server request-scoped bridge lane. The lane identity MUST NOT depend on a client-controlled request ID. The fork MUST leave the canonical bridge and its model metadata unchanged. Sequential idle requests of the same model class MAY keep reusing the canonical bridge. A pre-submit handoff reservation MUST protect its bridge from idle pruning and capacity eviction, and an aborted handoff MUST NOT leave its canonical bridge reserved. Owner forwarding MUST preserve whether the originating request was unanchored instead of treating a proxy-generated downstream turn-state as an explicit client anchor, and MUST fail closed when a mixed-version hop cannot authenticate that state. The v2 primary signature MUST bind whether client-IP metadata was present, while the companion signature MUST bind its value. When the canonical owner itself creates a fork for a forwarded request, it MUST own that fork locally instead of re-hashing it into another forwarding hop. Explicitly anchored owner forwards MUST retain the legacy-compatible primary signature during rolling upgrades, and a receiving instance MUST reject ambiguous delimiter-bearing legacy fields. Durable aliases derived from the forked lane MUST retain hard owner and account continuity.

#### Scenario: Background requests do not block behind a foreground turn

- **GIVEN** a foreground request is active on a session-header bridge
- **WHEN** two unanchored background requests arrive with the same session header
- **THEN** each background request uses an independent response-create gate
- **AND** neither request waits for the foreground response to complete
- **AND** the foreground bridge's model metadata remains unchanged

#### Scenario: Lookup-to-submit requests remain isolated

- **GIVEN** an unanchored request has reserved an idle canonical bridge but has not yet made queued activity visible
- **WHEN** another unanchored request arrives with the same session header and client request ID
- **THEN** the second request uses a distinct server-scoped bridge lane
- **AND** it does not reuse the reserved canonical bridge

#### Scenario: Cancelled pre-submit handoff does not strand a reservation

- **GIVEN** an unanchored request is reusing an idle canonical bridge
- **WHEN** the request is cancelled after claiming the bridge but before queued activity becomes visible
- **THEN** the canonical bridge remains unreserved
- **AND** later requests are not forced onto fork lanes by the cancelled lookup

#### Scenario: Remote owner preserves unanchored concurrency

- **GIVEN** an unanchored request is forwarded to the canonical bridge owner
- **AND** the proxy generated a downstream turn-state for response aliasing
- **WHEN** the owner receives the forwarded request while the canonical lane is active
- **THEN** the owner still treats the request as unanchored
- **AND** the request uses an independent bridge lane
- **AND** the pre-submit handoff remains reserved until submission becomes visible

#### Scenario: Owner-side fork does not start a second forwarding hop

- **GIVEN** an unanchored request has reached its canonical owner
- **AND** that owner creates an independent fork because the canonical lane is active
- **WHEN** rendezvous hashing the generated fork key would select another instance
- **THEN** the canonical owner creates and durably claims the fork locally
- **AND** the request is not rejected as a forwarding loop

#### Scenario: Blank turn-state is not an anchor

- **GIVEN** a request has a session header and an empty or whitespace-only turn-state header
- **WHEN** the request is forwarded to its owner
- **THEN** the signed forwarding context marks the original request as unanchored
- **AND** the generated downstream turn-state does not collapse it onto the canonical gate

#### Scenario: Forwarding downgrade fails closed

- **GIVEN** an owner-forward request requires unanchored concurrency semantics
- **WHEN** the signed unanchored boolean is changed, removed, or repacked into affinity fields, or either instance only supports the legacy signature
- **THEN** the owner-forward hop fails closed
- **AND** the request is not attached to the shared canonical response-create gate

#### Scenario: Anchored forwarding remains rolling-upgrade compatible

- **GIVEN** an owner-forward request carries explicit previous-response or turn-state continuity
- **WHEN** the origin and owner run different bridge protocol versions
- **THEN** the primary signature remains valid under the legacy contract
- **AND** the anchored request can continue without weakening unanchored fail-closed behavior

#### Scenario: Ambiguous legacy signature fields fail closed

- **GIVEN** a legacy owner-forward signature contains a delimiter in any signed header field
- **WHEN** field boundaries are repacked without changing the legacy joined byte string
- **THEN** a current owner rejects the forwarding context as invalid
- **AND** the repacked affinity kind cannot weaken hard continuity

#### Scenario: V2 client-IP metadata cannot be removed or blanked

- **GIVEN** an unanchored v2 owner-forward request carries signed client-IP metadata
- **WHEN** both client-IP headers are removed, the value is blanked, or the value is changed
- **THEN** the owner rejects the forwarding context as invalid
- **AND** a genuinely no-IP v2 request remains valid

#### Scenario: Durable fork continuation remains owner-bound

- **GIVEN** a forked lane has produced a durable turn-state or previous-response alias
- **WHEN** a later request resolves that alias on another instance
- **THEN** the request follows the hard owner-bound continuity path
- **AND** the original account binding is preserved

#### Scenario: Explicit continuation is not split

- **WHEN** a request carries `previous_response_id` or a turn-state header
- **THEN** the service keeps the request on the hard owner-bound continuity path
- **AND** it does not apply unanchored parallel-session isolation
