## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Responses requests accept input_file content items with a file_id

The system SHALL accept `input_file` content items that reference an upload by `file_id` in `/backend-api/codex/responses` and `/v1/responses` request payloads (both list-form and string-form `input`). These items MUST be forwarded to upstream verbatim. The same MUST apply to `/responses/compact` request bodies. The proxy MUST NOT raise `input_file.file_id is not supported` for these items.

#### Scenario: input_file with file_id is accepted in a /responses request

- **WHEN** a client posts a `/v1/responses` request whose `input` contains a `{"type": "input_file", "file_id": "file_abc"}` content item
- **THEN** the request validates and the upstream payload includes that content item unchanged

#### Scenario: input_file with file_id is accepted in a compact request

- **WHEN** a client posts a `/responses/compact` request whose `input` contains an `input_file` item with a `file_id`
- **THEN** the request validates and is forwarded to upstream verbatim
