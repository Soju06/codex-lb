# Project Conventions

Project conventions that must be reviewed before editing code.

## When to Activate

- Before editing `app/` code (auto-activated via PreToolUse guard)
- When implementing a new module or feature
- When refactoring or changing structure

## How to Use

1. Read `conventions.md` to review the current project coding rules.
2. Write/edit code in accordance with the rules.

### Action

Read the conventions file in this skill directory:

```
Read: .agents/skills/project-conventions/conventions.md
```

Proceed with code edits after reviewing the conventions.
