# API Key Authentication

API key auth is **disabled by default**. In that mode, only local requests to the protected proxy routes can
proceed without a key; non-local requests are rejected until proxy authentication is configured. Enable it in
**Settings → API Key Auth** on the dashboard when clients connect remotely or through Docker, VM, or container
networking that appears non-local to the service.

When enabled, clients must pass a valid API key as a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer sk-clb-...
```

## Protected routes

The protected proxy routes covered by this setting are:

- `/v1/*` (except `/v1/usage`, which always requires a valid key)
- `/backend-api/codex/*`
- `/backend-api/transcribe`

## Creating keys

Dashboard → API Keys → Create. The full key is shown **only once** at creation. Keys support optional expiration, model restrictions, and rate limits (tokens / cost per day / week / month).

Keys can also be scoped to specific accounts, so a key draws quota only from the accounts assigned to it:

![API keys with assigned accounts](screenshots/apis-assigned-accounts.jpg)

For a scoped key, **Local account usage share** optionally limits the key to a percentage of each assigned
account's 7-day quota budget. The budget is estimated in request-cost units from the account's current upstream
usage snapshot and all successful local API-key request logs for that account's current quota window. Once the key's
successful local request cost reaches its configured share on one account, routing skips that account and can
continue with another assigned account. This is not an account-wide cap; other keys retain their normal routing
behavior.

The policy deliberately does not enforce when the account has no live secondary snapshot, no recognized plan
capacity, or no attributable successful local cost in the current window. In those cases there is no defensible
USD-to-quota-credit conversion, so routing preserves its normal behavior. Accounting is request-log based and
settles asynchronously with request-log persistence; concurrent requests can therefore pass before a prior
request's log is committed.

## Reasoning effort policies

A key can either enforce one reasoning effort or allow a selected non-empty set of client-requested efforts.
Leave the allowed-efforts selection empty to keep the existing unrestricted behavior. A request that explicitly
sets an effort outside its key's allowlist receives a `403 reasoning_effort_not_allowed` response. Requests that
omit a reasoning effort continue to use the model or upstream default.

The policy evaluates the effort selected by the client, including supported model aliases such as `-xhigh`.
Each configured effort is distinct: allowing `high` does not allow `xhigh`, and allowing `max` does not allow
`ultra`. The proxy still rewrites an allowed `ultra` request to the upstream wire value `max`.
