## Why

Source-model Codex catalog entries hardcode `supported_reasoning_levels=()`,
`default_reasoning_level=None`, and `supports_reasoning_summaries=False`. Every
other client-capability field on those entries is an operator-overridable
`raw_metadata_json` default, so a reasoning-capable backend has no way to
advertise its efforts and Codex clients show no reasoning-effort options for
model-source models.

The efforts themselves already reach the source: the Responses path forwards
`reasoning` unchanged, so an operator who hardcodes `model_reasoning_effort` in
`config.toml` gets working reasoning today. Only the advertisement is missing,
which makes the capability undiscoverable in the client UI.

Backends differ in the efforts they accept — for example Alibaba Model Studio
exposes `none`/`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`, while DeepSeek and
Kimi expose `low`/`high`/`max` — so the advertised set has to be operator
declared rather than inferred.

## What Changes

- Read `supported_reasoning_levels`, `default_reasoning_level`, and
  `supports_reasoning_summaries` for source-model catalog entries from
  `raw_metadata_json` instead of hardcoding them.
- Accept both effort slugs (`["low", "high"]`) and objects
  (`[{"effort": "low", "description": "..."}]`), ignoring malformed entries.
- Keep the existing no-reasoning behavior for models that do not opt in.
