## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Full upstream conversation archive
The proxy MUST provide an opt-in durable archive of Codex-to-upstream conversation traffic. When enabled, the archive MUST write gzip-compressed newline-delimited JSON records for upstream request payloads, streamed Responses events, compact response payloads, and websocket text or binary frames without performing gzip file I/O in the request event loop during normal operation. The archive writer queue MUST be bounded and MUST apply synchronous write backpressure instead of growing without limit when the background writer is saturated. Archive records MUST include request id, timestamp, direction, traffic kind, transport, account id when known, upstream target metadata, redacted headers, and the full payload or frame body. Credential-bearing headers such as authorization, cookies, proxy authorization, token headers, and API key headers MUST be redacted before persistence. JSON records MUST preserve non-ASCII payload text as UTF-8 rather than Unicode escape sequences. When disabled, no archive file MUST be created by the archive writer.

#### Scenario: operator enables archive for audit
- **WHEN** `CODEX_LB_CONVERSATION_ARCHIVE_ENABLED=true`
- **AND** a Codex Responses request is proxied upstream
- **THEN** the archive records both the outbound upstream payload and inbound upstream events or response body as gzip JSONL
- **AND** credential-bearing headers are stored as redacted values

#### Scenario: archive remains disabled by default
- **WHEN** the archive setting is not enabled
- **THEN** the archive writer does not create conversation archive files

#### Scenario: operator views archived traffic
- **GIVEN** conversation archive files exist as `.jsonl.gz` or legacy `.jsonl`
- **WHEN** an authenticated dashboard operator opens an existing request log detail
- **THEN** the dashboard can find matching archive records by request id across archive files and display payload plus metadata for that request
