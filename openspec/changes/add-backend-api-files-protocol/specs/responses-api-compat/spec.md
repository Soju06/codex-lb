## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Responses requests accept input_file content items with a file_id

The system SHALL accept `input_file` content items that reference an upload by `file_id` in `/backend-api/codex/responses` and `/v1/responses` request payloads (both list-form and string-form `input`). These items MUST be forwarded to upstream verbatim. The same MUST apply to `/responses/compact` request bodies. The proxy MUST NOT raise `input_file.file_id is not supported` for these items.

#### Scenario: input_file with file_id is accepted in a /responses request

- **WHEN** a client posts a `/v1/responses` request whose `input` contains a `{"type": "input_file", "file_id": "file_abc"}` content item
- **THEN** the request validates and the upstream payload includes that content item unchanged

#### Scenario: input_file with file_id is accepted in a compact request

- **WHEN** a client posts a `/responses/compact` request whose `input` contains an `input_file` item with a `file_id`
- **THEN** the request validates and is forwarded to upstream verbatim

### Requirement: Responses requests with input_file.file_id route to the upload's account

A `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses`, or `/responses/compact` request that references an `{type: "input_file", file_id}` content item SHALL be routed to the upstream account that registered the file via `POST /backend-api/files`, when an in-memory pin for that `file_id` is still live. Stronger affinity signals MUST take precedence over the file_id pin: an explicit `prompt_cache_key`, a session header (`StickySessionKind.CODEX_SESSION`), a turn-state header, or a `previous_response_id` MUST keep their existing routing semantics.

When multiple `file_id`s are referenced and several are pinned, the most-recently-pinned one MUST be preferred (with a deterministic lexicographic tie-break on `file_id`).

#### Scenario: file_id pin drives routing for an input_file response

- **GIVEN** a `POST /backend-api/files` registered `file_xyz` through `account_a`
- **WHEN** a `/v1/responses` request references `{"type": "input_file", "file_id": "file_xyz"}` and has no stronger affinity
- **THEN** the proxy MUST route the request to `account_a`

#### Scenario: prompt_cache_key overrides the file_id pin

- **GIVEN** a pinned `file_xyz -> account_a`
- **WHEN** a `/v1/responses` request references `file_xyz` AND sets an explicit `prompt_cache_key`
- **THEN** the proxy MUST follow the prompt-cache affinity for routing and MUST NOT use the file_id pin
