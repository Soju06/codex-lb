## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Model-capacity messages are retryable transient failures

When upstream returns a temporary model-capacity failure whose message says that the selected model is at capacity, the proxy MUST treat the failure as retryable transient even if the upstream error code or HTTP status would otherwise look non-retryable.

#### Scenario: Selected model capacity with invalid request code is retryable

- **WHEN** upstream returns an error envelope with `error.message = "Selected model is at capacity. Please try a different model."`
- **AND** the normalized error code is `invalid_request_error`
- **AND** the HTTP status is `400`
- **THEN** `classify_upstream_failure` returns `failure_class = "retryable_transient"`
- **AND** pre-visible streaming/websocket paths are eligible to retry or fail over instead of surfacing a terminal client error.

#### Scenario: Quota and rate-limit codes retain their stronger classification

- **WHEN** upstream returns a quota or rate-limit error code
- **THEN** the proxy MUST keep classifying it as quota or rate-limit before applying message-based model-capacity detection.

#### Scenario: Classified quota failures still use the model-capacity replay wait

- **WHEN** a replayable pre-created HTTP bridge request receives the selected-model capacity message with a quota or
  rate-limit error code
- **THEN** the proxy MUST preserve that quota or rate-limit classification for account health handling
- **AND** the proxy MUST still apply the model-capacity wait before replaying the request.

### Requirement: HTTP bridge model-capacity retry waits preserve stream contracts

The proxy MUST wait before replaying a pre-created HTTP bridge request with a selected-model capacity failure only
when the failure happened before any downstream-visible response event and the request is still replayable as a fresh
request.

#### Scenario: Public propagated-error streams do not receive pre-retry keepalives

- **WHEN** a `/v1/responses`-compatible HTTP bridge stream is configured to propagate startup HTTP errors
- **AND** upstream returns a selected-model capacity error before `response.created`
- **THEN** the proxy MUST NOT emit `codex.keepalive` or account-capacity wait events before the retry completes.

#### Scenario: Replay waits remain bounded by the original bridge deadline

- **WHEN** the selected-model capacity error arrives near or after the original bridge request deadline
- **THEN** the proxy MUST NOT start a fresh upstream replay after that deadline is exhausted.

#### Scenario: Only fresh replayable bridge requests wait

- **WHEN** the selected-model capacity error belongs to an anchored request that cannot be replayed without
  `previous_response_id`
- **THEN** the proxy MUST forward the terminal error promptly without sleeping for the model-capacity retry delay.

#### Scenario: Retry-safe injected anchors still wait

- **WHEN** the proxy injected `previous_response_id` and retained a fresh request body that is safe to replay without
  that anchor
- **AND** upstream returns a selected-model capacity error before visible output
- **THEN** the proxy MUST apply the model-capacity wait before stripping the injected anchor and replaying the fresh
  request.

#### Scenario: Remote-owner relay preserves the hidden startup wait

- **WHEN** an origin replica forwards a bridge request to its remote owner
- **THEN** the origin MUST keep its startup probe pending until the owner relay returns response headers or a terminal
  startup error
- **AND** a selected-model capacity wait on the owner MUST NOT cause the origin to commit HTTP 200 before that wait
  completes.

#### Scenario: Waiting keeps the retry tied to the pending request

- **WHEN** the proxy waits before replaying a selected-model capacity failure
- **THEN** the request MUST remain reserved in the bridge pending queue while it waits
- **AND** the proxy MUST retain the session response-create gate so a younger request cannot enter while the sole
  upstream reader is sleeping
- **AND** the proxy MUST release account-level and shared response-create capacity during the wait
- **AND** the proxy MUST reacquire both capacity leases before sending the replay
- **AND** the proxy MUST skip the replay if that queued request detaches before the wait completes.
