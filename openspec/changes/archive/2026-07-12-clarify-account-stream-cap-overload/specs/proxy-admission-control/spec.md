## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Local overload reasons are stable and distinguishable

Local Responses overload failures MUST expose stable low-cardinality reason fields in logs and metrics so operators can distinguish `bridge_queue_full`, `response_create_gate_timeout`, `hard_affinity_saturated`, `previous_response_owner_unavailable`, `global_admission_timeout`, `capacity_exhausted_active_sessions`, `account_response_create_cap`, and `account_stream_cap`. These local reasons MUST NOT be reported as upstream rate limits or generic upstream unavailability.

#### Scenario: Bridge queue saturation is not ambiguous

- **WHEN** a local HTTP bridge queue rejects a request
- **THEN** logs and metrics use the stable reason `bridge_queue_full`
- **AND** they do not use the ambiguous alias `queue_full`

#### Scenario: Account cap rejection is local overload

- **WHEN** every eligible account is unavailable because of account-local caps
- **THEN** the HTTP response is a local overload response with `Retry-After`
- **AND** logs and metrics identify `account_response_create_cap` or `account_stream_cap`
- **AND** the error message identifies the exhausted account-local cap instead of saying all upstream accounts are unavailable
