## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Account-local Responses work is capped before upstream creation

For `/v1/responses`, `/backend-api/codex/responses`, and compact Responses traffic, the proxy MUST enforce account-local response-create and streaming concurrency limits in addition to process-wide admission limits. The default account response-create cap MUST be 4 and the default account stream cap MUST be 8 unless operators configure a different value. When an account is at either cap, new soft-affinity work MUST prefer another eligible account before returning local overload. Hard-continuity work MAY fail closed when the required owner account is saturated.

#### Scenario: Soft work avoids saturated account

- **GIVEN** account A is at its account response-create cap
- **AND** account B is eligible and below cap
- **WHEN** a soft-affinity `/v1/responses` request is routed
- **THEN** the proxy selects account B instead of queueing on account A

#### Scenario: Hard continuity owner saturation fails closed

- **GIVEN** a follow-up request requires a specific previous-response owner account
- **AND** that account is at its account stream or response-create cap
- **WHEN** no safe continuity-preserving alternative exists
- **THEN** the proxy returns a bounded local overload/continuity failure
- **AND** the failure reason is stable and low-cardinality

### Requirement: Local overload reasons are stable and distinguishable

Local Responses overload failures MUST expose stable low-cardinality reason fields in logs and metrics so operators can distinguish `bridge_queue_full`, `response_create_gate_timeout`, `hard_affinity_saturated`, `previous_response_owner_unavailable`, `global_admission_timeout`, `capacity_exhausted_active_sessions`, `account_response_create_cap`, and `account_stream_cap`. These local reasons MUST NOT be reported as upstream rate limits.

#### Scenario: Bridge queue saturation is not ambiguous

- **WHEN** a local HTTP bridge queue rejects a request
- **THEN** logs and metrics use the stable reason `bridge_queue_full`
- **AND** they do not use the ambiguous alias `queue_full`

#### Scenario: Account cap rejection is local overload

- **WHEN** every eligible account is unavailable because of account-local caps
- **THEN** the HTTP response is a local overload response with `Retry-After`
- **AND** logs and metrics identify `account_response_create_cap` or `account_stream_cap`
