## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: gpt-5.4-mini pricing is recognized

The system MUST recognize `gpt-5.4-mini` pricing when computing request costs. Snapshot aliases for the same model family MUST resolve to the canonical `gpt-5.4-mini` price table entry.

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4-mini request priced at standard tier

- **WHEN** a request for `gpt-5.4-mini` completes with standard service tier
- **THEN** the system computes non-zero cost using the configured `gpt-5.4-mini` standard rates

#### Scenario: gpt-5.4-mini snapshot request priced at canonical rates

- **WHEN** a request for `gpt-5.4-mini-2026-03-17` completes
- **THEN** the system resolves the snapshot alias to `gpt-5.4-mini`
- **AND** the system applies the same standard rates
